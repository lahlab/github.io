   <a title="LaHLab GitHub projects" href="./"> LaHLab GitHub space<br>
    <span class="sml">LaHLab was originaly the working name for a makerspace. But illnes
got inbetween. The name kind of stuck and now it's mostly about
coding for recovery and WHORTH.</span></a></li>
   <li><b>./health.html</b>
   <a title="Health info" href="./health.html"> LaH: Brief health overview<br>
    <span class="sml">LaHLab is my playground for recovery and primarly WHORTH development.
It suits well as it take allot of thinking that can be done in the
forest - The best place for recovery. But what am I recovering from
and how did I end up here?</span></a></li>
   <li><b>./lah.html</b>
   <a title="LaH - Lars Hallberg" href="./lah.html"> LaH - Lars Hallberg<br>
    <span class="sml">Been programming since the early 80's but a bit
more than the last 10 years have been a black hole of illness.
Issue finally found and code for recovery.</span></a></li>

   <li><b>./whorth/</b>
   <a title="WHORTH" href="./whorth/"> WHORTH - The ugly duckling of FORTH<br>
    <span class="sml">WHORTH is an atempt to make a FORTH inspired language with duck typing,
slightly more 'friendly' parsing with cleaner string literals and more.
All with keeping FORTHS simplicity and extendability.</span></a></li>
   <li><b>./whorth/license.html</b>
   <a title="License for WHORTH" href="./whorth/license.html"> License for WHORTH - MPL 2.0?<br>
    <span class="sml">Mild copyleft is wanted. People should be able to use the WHORTH
code, change the WHORTH code, mix it with any code they like,
build the program they want and use and distribute there program
on the terms they like. Only on the condition they share back any
changes they do to the WHORTH code itself and preserve the same
rights to others on that WHORTH code.</span></a></li>
   <li><b>./whorth/roadmap.html</b>
   <a title="WHORTH RoadMap" href="./whorth/roadmap.html"> WHORTH RoadMap<br>
    <span class="sml">Due to uncertainty about how fast I get well the roadmap have no
time frame. But still an indication of how things are likely to
progress.</span></a></li>
   <li><b>./whorth/trains.html</b>
   <a title="WHORTH trains" href="./whorth/trains.html"> WHORTH's trains - a word parsing feature<br>
    <span class="sml">WHORTH's parsing is slightly different then FORTH's. It is still word
based but in addition to space it also break words on the inside of
parentheses <tt>{[()]}</tt> and it also is aware of strings with
double ticks ie: <tt>"double quotes"</tt>.</span></a></li>
   <li><b>./whorth/vision.html</b>
   <a title="WHORTH, vision and FORTH" href="./whorth/vision.html"> WHORTH, vision and FORTH<br>
    <span class="sml">WHORTH is inspired by FORTH. mainly early FORTH - think FORTH79 and
earlier (I'm old enough). But it also try to bring new stuff to the
table and are different enough that code compability with standard
FORTH is not a meaningful target.</span></a></li>
