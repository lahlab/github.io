<div><h1>WHORTH</h1>
<h2>The ugly duckling of FORTH</h2>
<p class="ing">WHORTH is an atempt to make a FORTH inspired language with duck typing,
slightly more 'friendly' parsing with cleaner string literals and more.
All with keeping FORTHS simplicity and extendability.</p>
<h3>WHORTH, vision and FORTH</h3>
      <p><a class="trml" title="WHORTH, vision and FORTH" 
         href="vision.html">»</a>
      WHORTH is inspired by FORTH. mainly early FORTH - think FORTH79 and
earlier (I'm old enough). But it also try to bring new stuff to the
table and are different enough that code compability with standard
FORTH is not a meaningful target.</p>
   <h3>WHORTH RoadMap</h3>
      <p><a class="trml" title="WHORTH RoadMap" 
         href="roadmap.html">»</a>
      Due to uncertainty about how fast I get well the roadmap have no
time frame. But still an indication of how things are likely to
progress.</p>
   <h3>WHORTH trains</h3>
      <p><a class="trml" title="WHORTH's trains - a word parsing feature" 
         href="trains.html">»</a>
      WHORTH's parsing is slightly different then FORTH's. It is still word
based but in addition to space it also break words on the inside of
parentheses <tt>{[()]}</tt> and it also is aware of strings with
double ticks ie: <tt>"double quotes"</tt>.</p>
   <h3>License for WHORTH</h3>
      <p><a class="trml" title="License for WHORTH - MPL 2.0?" 
         href="license.html">»</a>
      Mild copyleft is wanted. People should be able to use the WHORTH
code, change the WHORTH code, mix it with any code they like,
build the program they want and use and distribute there program
on the terms they like. Only on the condition they share back any
changes they do to the WHORTH code itself and preserve the same
rights to others on that WHORTH code.</p>

<h3>The WHORTH institutionalized patient for life</h3>

<p class="ing">As I understand things You get a cool title for life when You make a programming language. I have chosen My - that's probably not how it works... But... Hey... Everyone must agree it is an appropriate title.<a class="rml" title="read more" href="../lah.html">»</a></p>
